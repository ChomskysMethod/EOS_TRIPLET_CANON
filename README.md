## 📦 Multi-Format EOS Canon

For broader compatibility and accessibility, the EOS seed has been exported to multiple formats:

- 📄 `EOS_SEED_CANONICAL_v1.0h.txt` — Plain text for command-line access
- 🌐 `EOS_SEED_CANONICAL_v1.0h.html` — Web-native format for direct viewing
- 📘 `EOS_SEED_CANONICAL_v1.0h.pdf` — Print-optimized, portable format

All are bundled into:
- 📦 `EOS_SEED_CANONICAL_v1.0h_MULTI_FORMAT.zip`

These formats ensure EOS remains interpretable across time, systems, and sensory modes. No agent is excluded from recognition.
